# BackupScript

This script is designed to backup a specific folder onto a specific removable USB drive or location, each backup is saved by the date the script was run on. When the script is run, it searches the folder to see if a backup has been made that day already, as well as if the source and destination folders exist. The script then scans the folder to see how far back the history goes, if there is more than 5 backups present, the script deletes the oldest backup. The script then commences backup up your files and informing you of the size of the file.

Based in Python, this script shows the ability to navigate folders and perform folder operations such as searching, iterating, copying and deleting folders.
