# BackupScript

This script is designed to backup a specific folder onto a specific removable USB drive or location, each backup is saved by the date it was completed. When the script is run, it searches the folder to see if a backup has been made today already. The script then scans the folder to see how far back the history goes, if there is more than 5 backups present, the script deletes the oldest backup. Once this has completed, the script commences backup up your files and informing you of the size of the file.
